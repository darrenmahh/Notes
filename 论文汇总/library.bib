  abstract = {Due to increased loss of wetland areas globally, restoration of wetlands has become common practice and is applied to increase wetland areas as well as improving ecological services of existing wetlands. Although the importance of wetlands in carbon sequestration has been recognized, the effects of restoration activities on CO2 release and uptake are still unknown. We measured net-ecosystem exchange (NEE) in two sites, a natural site and a restored site, at the New Jersey Meadowlands, an urban tidal wetland, using the eddy-covariance method from 2014 to 2016. These data were used to compare the two sites and understand the effects of restoration on NEE. A procedure was developed to partition measured fluxes between vegetation types, using footprint modeling and light response curves. Following the partitioning, we compared CO2 fluxes from invasive and native wetland vegetation communities. Separating flux data into vegetation communities and to seasonal and diurnal fluxes revealed patterns in CO2 fluxes that allowed determining the nature of each vegetation cover as a source or sink for CO2. Our results show that CO2 emissions from the restored wetland were significantly higher than the natural wetland. During restoration, the invasive wetland species Phragmites australis was replaced by the native Spartina alterniflora, which was then found to have an increased CO2 uptake during summer days, but also higher CO2 emissions during nights and winters. Therefore, the wetland restoration practice might be responsible for the increased carbon dioxide release. Additionally, allochthonous carbon input from the river to the wetland was found to be larger at the restored site. Thus, during the study, S. alterniflora that was introduced to the restored wetland site was serving as a carbon source, releasing CO2 to the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Estimation of carbon and nitrogen stocks is important for quantifying carbon and nitrogen sequestration as well as greenhouse gas emissions and inventorying national carbon and nitrogen balances. For Liaoning province of China, we estimated the vertical distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (STN), bulk density (BD), and mapped their spatial distribution at five standard soil depth intervals (0--5, 5--15, 15--30, 30--60 and 60--100 cm) using nine environmental variables as predictors including precipitation, temperature, land use, elevation, system for automated geoscientific analyses (SAGA) wetness index, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The highest average contents of SOC and STN were 15.2 g kg-1 and 1.6 g kg- 1 in the 0--5 cm soil layer, and 1.5 g kg-1 SOC and 0.4 g kg-1 STN in the 60--100 cm soil layer, respectively. The prediction precision for SOC, STN and BD all decreased with soil depth. Average SOC and STN stocks for 0--30 cm were 3.1 kg m- 2 and 0.5 kg m- 2, respectively. For the top 1 m, SOC and STN were 4.5 kg m- 2 and 0.9 kg m- 2, respectively. In total, the soils stored approximately 588 Tg SOC and 128 Tg STN within the top 1 m. The soils under forest had the highest amount of carbon (356 Tg) and nitrogen (58 Tg) followed by agriculture and wetland that contributed 34\% and 48\% of the total stock, respectively. {$>$} 91\% of the total SOC and STN stocks were in Argosols and Cambosols. We adopted a digital soil mapping method to map the spatial distribution of SOC and STN stocks and predict their uncertainties. The estimation was validated with a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. The data and high-resolution maps from this study can be used for future soil carbon and nitrogen assessment and inventorying.},

  abstract = {As crucial carbon sinks within terrestrial ecosystems, wetlands have been extensively studied in terms of spatio-temporal distributions. However, existing methods for classifying wetlands are of limited accuracy, and it is difficult to acquire consistent samples over time. Therefore, precise classification methods are required to facilitate wetland conservation and ecological restoration. In this study, multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms in combination with feature sets based on Sentinel-2 data were used to accurately classify the land-use types (LUTs) of the Bosten Lake Wetland (BLW) in Xinjiang, China. The enhanced water index (EWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), and normalised difference water index (NDWI) were selected to extract water information and distinguish water bodies from land surfaces in the BLW. Three classification plans based on vegetation indices, water indices, and textural features were developed using artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) algorithms. Plan 9 combined vegetation water and texture with the highest overall accuracy (OA) 91.02\% and kappa coefficient (KC) 0.89. This plan obtained a producer accuracy of over 90\% for lake wetlands, river wetlands, grassland wetlands, mud flats, and farmland and {$>$}83\% for construction land and bareland. According to Plan 9, the wetland area during 2018--2023 showed noticeable seasonal fluctuations but stable interannual changes. Conversely, non-wetland areas demonstrated significant interannual fluctuations, particularly in bareland and farmland, which might have been influenced by urbanisation and ecological policies. This study provides insights into the data sources, feature selection, and methodological approaches for wetland information extraction in arid regions.},
